## Bio

Esther moved to London to work for a big company after graduation, while taking small orders from social media in her spare time as a freelance illustrator. She enjoys to have dinner or drinks with a couple of friends after work, then walk back to her small apartment at the end of her long day. 

She tends to avoid the park area at night, even though it was the quicker way home. If she feels fearsome, she would grip her keys and phone really hard to keep calm. Esther also calls her family or pretends she's on the phone if she feels necessary. Although Esther found it troublesome, it seemed like an invisible pact that she would always text her friends in their group chat when she got home, and so did her friends.

"Text me when you get home xxx."



## Goals and needs

- Let family and close friends to know her location or situation
- Sent her get home message as punctual as she is, if nothing went wrong
- To know which area is potential unsafe
- Able to pick up a fake call and put on speaker



## Pain points

- Doesn't want to know where people are 24 hours a day, doesn't want people to know where she is 24 hours a day, either
- Always need to inform friends - she's free-spirited and forgetful, but her friends do
- Not terribly tech-savvy, doesn't like tedious operation



## Stakeholder Analysisï¼š

Esther is based on the stories of "*Sarah Evrard murder*" and "*Sabina Nessa murder*" and their relevant reports,  she is an abstract representation of a character who needs to walking alone at night. 

"Esthers" want to stay away from potantial danger and get trusted help when needed. The app should make Esther feel guarded, let trusted one know when and where Easter needs help and be easy to use.
